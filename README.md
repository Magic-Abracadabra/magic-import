# Importing is Installing!
A brief way to use your codes. Just
```python
import magic_install
```
Usually, everything will get done for you. Modules can be installed before your later imports.

If you don't have numpy,
```python
import numpy as np
```
will install numpy first, and then numpy will be successfully installed. Yeah, that easy.

After import one package, the following libraries will work, too:
```python
import pyaudio, pymovie, pyautogui, ...
```
